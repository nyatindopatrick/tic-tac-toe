# `Tic-Tac-Toe Game`

- This is a game for 2 players. While starting the game you will be asked to enter your names. After that, you will see a big square divided in 9 equally sized smaller spaces. In each turn, the player chooses an empty space. Each player icon is unique and it is represented either by `X` or `O`. The main goal of this game is to mark a straight single line in sequence. This will make you a `winner`. You are not allowed to take other's player position. You should only capture `free` spaces. If, in the end, none of the players achieve a straight single line the result is `Draw` and you have to re-run a new one. 


--- 
`Think wisely each time you choose your space.`
--- 
`You need to have a good strategy if you want to be the winner.`
